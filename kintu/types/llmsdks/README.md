# LLM SDK types

Types from the underlying LLM SDKs, collected and re-exported with a `Raw*` prefix. 

For convenience, but also because we wrap the SDKs while exposing the underlying inputs/outputs, we rely on
the underlying types fairly commonly. And the SDKs do not always have well organized/easy-to-find types.
